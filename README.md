ClothSim in Rust. I bet a friend that I can learn enough Rust to hack together a verlet-integration based algorithm to simulate a piece of cloth, and render it with opengl, in 1 day. This is the result. If you click, it "pushes" the cloth in the Z (towards out of your screen) direction, and that is it. Super simple, very hacky and barely works! (but it does!)
